## Back Down The Tower

In this game, you've most definitely defeated the boss, and you just need to go back down the tower to go home and buy groceries and walk your dog (groceries and dog not part of the game).

Unfortunately, you've used a cheat code to get to the boss and all of the enemies and traps are still there.  Too bad the cheat code was a one-way ticket since it was bought from a shady cube.
